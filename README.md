# jkstra - A simple graph and routing library

**jkstra** is a JavaScript library to work with **graphs** - as in "data structures", with edges and vertices, not as in "graphics".

[See an interactive demo](http://bbecquet.github.io/jkstra/demo/).

It was made originally as a base model for a webapp that needed to run offline shortest path computations on a public transportation network.

For now it supports simple directed graphs and provides implementations Dijkstra and A\* algorithms to find shortest paths in it.

```bash
npm install jkstra
```

## Simple example

```javascript
var jkstra = require("<path_to_jkstra>");

var graph = new jkstra.Graph();

var n = []; // to easily keep references to the node objects

n.push(graph.addVertex(0));
n.push(graph.addVertex(1));
n.push(graph.addVertex(2));
n.push(graph.addVertex(3));
n.push(graph.addVertex(4)); // the parameter is arbitrary data assigned to the node
n.push(graph.addVertex({ id: 666, label: "A node holding complex data" }));

console.log(n[3].data); // => 3
console.log(n[5].data); // => {id: 666, label: 'A node holding complex data'}

graph.addEdge(n[0], n[1], 7); // The edges are directed. Here, only the edge from 0 to 1 is created.
graph.addEdgePair(n[0], n[2], 9); // But two opposite edges sharing the same data can be easily created
graph.addEdge(n[0], n[5], 14);
graph.addEdge(n[1], n[2], 10);
graph.addEdge(n[1], n[3], 15);
graph.addEdge(n[2], n[5], 2);
graph.addEdge(n[2], n[3], 12); // As for the nodes, you can assign any data to the edge.
graph.addEdge(n[3], n[4], 6); // Here we use it to store a single value which will be used as a cost.
graph.addEdge(n[5], n[4], 10);

// you can access edges from nodes with the outEdges/inEdges function
console.log(
  graph
    .outEdges(n[5])
    .map(function (e) {
      return e.data;
    })
    .join()
);
// => [10]

var dijkstra = new jkstra.algos.Dijkstra(graph);

// computes the shortestPath between nodes 0 and 4,
// using the single number stored in each as its cost
var path = dijkstra.shortestPath(n[0], n[4], {
  edgeCost: function (e) {
    return e.data;
  },
});

// the result is an array of the edge objects that make the path
console.log(
  path
    .map(function (e) {
      return e.data;
    })
    .join()
);
// => [9, 2, 10]
```
